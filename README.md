To kick-start my python coding career I will do a couple of solid django project sites and this was the first 7 hour course that felt well rounded creating a forum like with login and CRUD functionality in the Python Django framework.

Things thag got clearer during this project

- hot reload of browser for Django on save https://github.com/tjwalch/django-livereload-server
